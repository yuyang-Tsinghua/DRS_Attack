1. run ``make'' to get the lib files
2. run ``gen_training.py'' to generate data for training
3. run ``gen_model.py'' to train the models
4. run ``attack.py'' to check the attack

The outputs of ``attack.py'' are included in the folder ``attack'':

The graphs for *scaled weights* are stored in the folder ``attack/graph''.

Experimental results are stored in the folder ``attack/data''.
``S i.dat' includes the secret matrix of the i-th instance.
``guess i_j.dat'' includes the guess of the secret matrix of the i-th instance and experimental results measure over j samples.
``stat i.dat'' includes the statistics of sign prediction for large coefficients:
sample size
#(correct predictions for large S[i, l] with i < l) #(large S[i, l] with i < l) the accuracy of sign prediction for large S[i, l] with i < l
#(correct predictions for large S[i, l] with i > l) #(large S[i, l] with i > l) the accuracy of sign prediction for large S[i, l] with i > l

NOTE: In our paper, we measure the accuracy of sign prediction over 20 instances, which can be calculated from 20 ``guess i_j.dat'' or ``stat i.dat''.
