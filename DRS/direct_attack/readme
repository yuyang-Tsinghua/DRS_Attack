The graphs for *scaled weights* are stored in the folder ``attack/graph''.

Experimental results are stored in the folder ``attack/data''.

``S i.dat' includes the secret matrix of the i-th instance.
``guess i_j.dat'' includes the guess of the secret matrix of the i-th instance and experimental results measure over j samples.
``stat i.dat'' includes the statistics of sign prediction for large coefficients:
sample size
#(correct predictions for large S[i, l] with i < l) #(large S[i, l] with i < l) the accuracy of sign prediction for large S[i, l] with i < l
#(correct predictions for large S[i, l] with i > l) #(large S[i, l] with i > l) the accuracy of sign prediction for large S[i, l] with i > l

NOTE: In our paper, we measure the accuracy of sign prediction over 20 instances, which can be calculated from 20 ``guess i_j.dat'' or ``stat i.dat''.
